# Jane Street Puzzle June 2024

This repository contains a Python solution to the Jane Street Puzzle of June 2024, which challenges solvers to place U.S. state names within a 5x5 grid following certain rules.

Before reading further, you should consider attempting the puzzle yourself, and thinking about the rules.

## Puzzle Overview

"Altered States 2" challenges solvers to score as many points as possible by arranging the names of U.S. states in a 5x5 grid of letters. State's names are spelled out using Kingâ€™s moves, and you are allowed to alter the name of each state by one letter. Each state in your grid contributes a score equal to its population in the 2020 census
[2020 census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_census#State_rankings), and certain special solution tags are possible.

## Solution Approach

The code solution here implements a niave--but surprisingly high scoring--search approach for constructing high scoring grids.

We start with an initial grid, and randomly alter `flips` number of characters. If the resulting grid admits a higher score than the previous grid, the search is restarted. Otherwise, we try again, allowing the search to run `ANNEALING_TIME` iterations--if a higher scoring grid has not been seen, the search ends and the highest scoring observed grid is returned. Importantly though, `flips` is a time varying parameter, begining as a large integer that decays to `1` as the current loop interation approaches the `ANNEALING_TIME`. This stocastic search scheme is sometimes refered to as __simulated anealing__. 

## Repository Structure

- `main.py`: The main search script.
- `states.json`: JSON file with state names and their respective populations.
- `/results`: Folder where results are temporarily stored.
- `/results/bests`: Folder containing the best solutions found during the my personal trial.

## Installation

No additional libraries are required beyond the Python Standard Library. The code is compatible with Python 3.6 and above.

## Usage Instructions

To run the search algorithm, execute the following command from the terminal:
```sh
python3 main.py
```
Top scoring grids will be saved to the results folder.

## Expected Output

The script outputs the progression of the score and states during the optimization process. When a new high score is achieved, it prints the current best grid and the corresponding states. All high scores and their grids are saved to the `/results` directory in JSON format.

The highest scoring grid I found was 
```
LMYWK
AISER
HCNST
FOIAO
LGRNH
```
which scores `242536477` total points from 26 states! __California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Maine, West Virginia, Idaho, Kansas, Arkansas, Iowa, Utah, Oregon, Louisiana, Alabama, Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Missouri, Indiana, Arizona, Virginia, New Jersey, Michigan, and Georgia__.
(approximately 73% of the toal population in 2020). This submission also achives three special-rule-citations 
- 20S - over 20 states
- 200M - over 200 million population
- C2C - unbroken coast to cost state chain.

## Performance
Depending on the users configuration, the search script may run for a few hours before terminating. However, it is lightwaight to the extent that five concurrent searches were able to be carried out on a 36GB 2023 MacBook Pro without degrading search speed.
